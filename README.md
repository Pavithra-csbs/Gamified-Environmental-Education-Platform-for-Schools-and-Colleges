Problem Statement:​

Students today often navigate a disconnected learning journey, juggling separate platforms
for academics, technical skills, and life lessons. There is an opportunity to better connect
theoretical knowledge with practical, real-world applications. By integrating vital topics like
financial literacy and ensuring full accessibility, we can enhance student engagement and
better prepare them for future challenges.​

Target End‑User: ​

Primary: Middle school, high school, and college students.​
Key Segment: Learners with physical disabilities who require accessible educational tools.​

Evidence/Insight:​

Students devalue vital life skills because they are taught separately from the core
      curriculum.​
2)   Juggling multiple, disconnected learning platforms causes cognitive fatigue and demotivates learners.
